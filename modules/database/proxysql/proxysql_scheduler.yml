# This example adds a schedule, it saves the scheduler config to disk, but
# avoids loading the scheduler config to runtime (this might be because
# several servers are being added and the user wants to push the config to
# runtime in a single batch using the M(proxysql_manage_config) module).  It
# uses supplied credentials to connect to the proxysql admin interface.
