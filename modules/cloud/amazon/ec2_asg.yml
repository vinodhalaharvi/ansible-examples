# Rolling ASG Updates

# Below is an example of how to assign a new launch config to an ASG and terminate old instances.
#
# All instances in "myasg" that do not have the launch configuration named "my_new_lc" will be terminated in
# a rolling fashion with instances using the current launch configuration, "my_new_lc".
#
# This could also be considered a rolling deploy of a pre-baked AMI.
#
# If this is a newly created group, the instances will not be replaced since all instances
# will have the current launch configuration.
